# Traffic Monitoring Alternatives for Raspberry Pi

Since ntopng compilation is failing, here are proven alternatives for traffic monitoring and per-device network insights:

## Option 1: Simplified ntopng (Recommended - Easy)
Uses pre-compiled Debian package instead of building from source.

**Usage:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d
```
- Web interface: http://192.168.3.11:3001
- No compilation required
- Same features as ntopng

## Option 2: Netdata (Comprehensive Monitoring)
Real-time system and network monitoring with beautiful dashboards.

**Usage:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.netdata.yml up -d
```
- Web interface: http://192.168.3.11:19999
- Network traffic per interface
- System resource monitoring
- Built-in ARM64 support

## Option 3: Bandwhich (CLI-based)
Lightweight command-line network utilization tool.

**Usage:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.bandwhich.yml up -d
docker exec -it bandwhich ./bandwhich --interface eth0
```
- Terminal-based interface
- Real-time per-process network usage
- Very lightweight

## Option 4: Router-based Monitoring
Configure monitoring directly on your router (if supported):

### For OpenWrt routers:
```bash
# Install luci-app-nlbwmon for bandwidth monitoring
opkg update
opkg install luci-app-nlbwmon
```

### For commercial routers:
- Enable SNMP and use tools like LibreNMS
- Use router's built-in traffic analyzer
- Configure netflow/sflow export

## Option 5: Custom Python Dashboard
Create a lightweight Streamlit app for network monitoring:

```bash
# Monitor network interfaces using psutil
pip install psutil speedtest-cli
```

## Recommendation

**Start with Option 1 (Simplified ntopng)** - it provides the same functionality without compilation issues. If that doesn't work, **Option 2 (Netdata)** gives you comprehensive monitoring including network traffic with proven ARM64 support.

Both options avoid the compilation complexity while providing the traffic monitoring and per-device insights you need for your home network infrastructure.
