# Traffic Monitoring Alternatives for Raspberry Pi

Since ntopng compilation is failing and the package isn't available in Debian repositories, here are proven alternatives for traffic monitoring and per-device network insights:

## Option 1: Netdata (Recommended - Proven ARM64 Support)
Real-time system and network monitoring with beautiful dashboards and excellent ARM64 support.

**Usage:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.netdata.yml up -d
```
- Web interface: http://192.168.3.11:19999
- Real-time network traffic per interface
- Per-process network usage
- Device discovery and monitoring
- Built-in ARM64 support
- No compilation required

## Option 2: Bandwhich (Lightweight CLI)
Terminal-based real-time network utilization tool.

**Usage:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.bandwhich.yml up -d
docker exec -it bandwhich ./bandwhich --interface eth0
```
- Real-time per-process network usage
- Very lightweight
- Command-line interface

## Option 3: Custom Python Network Monitor
Create a lightweight Streamlit dashboard for network monitoring using native Python tools.

**Benefits:**
- No compilation issues
- Customizable to your needs
- Integrates with existing Streamlit apps
- Uses psutil and scapy for network monitoring

## Option 4: Router-based Monitoring
Configure monitoring directly on your router/gateway:

### For OpenWrt routers:
```bash
opkg update
opkg install luci-app-nlbwmon
```

### For other routers:
- Enable SNMP and use LibreNMS
- Configure netflow/sflow export
- Use router's built-in traffic analyzer

## Option 5: SNMP + Grafana
Monitor network devices via SNMP with Grafana dashboards:
- Lightweight and reliable
- Works with most network equipment
- Integrates with existing Grafana setup

## **Immediate Recommendation**

**Use Netdata (Option 1)** - it's specifically designed for ARM systems, provides comprehensive network monitoring with per-device insights, and has an excellent web interface. It's the most reliable replacement for ntopng on Raspberry Pi.

**Fallback:** If you need more customization, create a custom Python Streamlit dashboard (Option 3) that integrates perfectly with your existing infrastructure.
